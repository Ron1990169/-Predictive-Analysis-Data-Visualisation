Statistical Analysis of factors influencing Life Expectancy

This document is an academic report submitted by Rohin Mehra for Assignment at Griffith College Dublin, as part of the Big Data Analysis and Management department.

Even though many studies have been conducted in the past on factors impacting life expectancy, including demographic characteristics, income composition, 
and mortality rates, there are still many more to be done. The impact of vaccination and the human development index has hitherto been overlooked.

In comparison to the previous 30 years, there has been great progress in the health sector, resulting in an improvement in human mortality rates, especially in developing countries. 
As a result, for this study, we looked at data from 193 nations from 2000 to 2015. Individual data files were combined into a single data collection.
A cursory examination of the data revealed some missing numbers. We discovered no obvious flaws because the data sets came from WHO.


We will be more over-focused on these three questions as overall analysis shows these three questions gain superiority in our progression of work in this document.
How do Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
Do densely populated countries tend to have a lower life expectancy?
What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?

Health Factors Affecting Life Expectancy
Many associated factors contribute to affecting the Life Expectancy of people across the whole world.
It can be broadly categorized into three aspects First is Diseases (Alcohol Consumption, Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, Diphtheria, HIV AIDS), 
and the Second is Population Overall Health such as death rates, body mass index, population thinness (Infant Deaths, Under Five Deaths, BMI, Population Thinness) 
and Lastly by Country’s Net Income and Expenditures with education levels also being looked at (Percentage Expenditure, Total Expenditure, GDP, Income Composition of Resources, 
Schooling).

I Rohin Mehra, Student of Griffith College South Circular Road (author of the report) gratefully acknowledge the contributions of professor Dr Waseem Akhtar, 
For his persistent motivation and always making tough decisions so simple to take that it makes learner’s knowledge and also embed students with new innovative ideas 
in their careers.
